# Connected components and Minimum spanning trees
This project was made as an exploration into greedy algorithms and graph theory. Kindly look into the presentation pdf for details, titled: 'Greedy algorithms for graphs.pdf'


The documentation for the use of files for this project, detailiing how to replicate the process using the files will be added soon.
